Worked with: Oliver Cuzzort

Clarified where the notifications would be called for the package in the Update() function since him
and James and implemented the Update() functions of Drone and Robot. Also, helped out with the logic 
of how to make delivery_veicle have a refernce to the IEntityObservers list.
